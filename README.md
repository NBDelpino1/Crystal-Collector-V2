1. Here's how the app works:
	* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

	* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

	* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
		* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
		* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

	* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

	* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

	* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
		* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

	* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

	

##### Game design notes:
 * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
 
 * Each pokemon has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
